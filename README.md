This MakeCode extension provides simple pseudorandom number generator blocks using the algorithm posted here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29450606

It should work for all MakeCode environments but has been specifically tested for Arcade and Minecraft. 

To use it, import this repository as an extension in your MakeCode editor. Unless you're using MakeCode for Minecraft, which currently doesn't support GitHub links. To import the extension for Minecraft, import this extension to MakeCode Arcade and then use the share function, publish a link, and import that makecode.com link into MakeCode for Minecraft as an extension.
